I hope you are as excited as we are about today, just a couple of things for when the launch goes live:
1. There will not be any transport options available for the early bird, these will be added on at a later date which we will give plenty of notice for
2. The codes will be released in on our instagram story (@sheff_snow) and in the group chat so keep your eyes peeled at 12:00 
Any questions, just pop them in the winter trip group chat! 
Piste and love,

We are flying through early bird tickets and are expecting to sell out very soon 🤭
- Are there any questions stopping anyone from booking on? (Send them in here as I’m sure other people will be thinking the same thing 🫶🏼)
You will want to make sure you secure your space before term starts and all the freshers get involved 🫡
[30/08/2024, 11:35:23 am] Ruby Allen: 🎿 EARLY BIRD TICKETS OVER 90% SOLD OUT 🎿 

Tickets are flying out fast, with only a few remaining, and we expect them to sell out either today or tomorrow. So don't miss your chance to secure your place for what I can promise will be one of the best (and most chaotic) weeks of your university experience 🤭

As always, any questions send them our way. Thanks for all the love so far on the trip, very excited for the year ahead with you all 😈

Pls pls don't forget to join the Winter Trip group chat in this community if you are interested in coming along! We've had lots of useful questions asked in there that might just convince you to come along if you are still undecided 😉 

Piste and Love,

✨️ SheffSnow ✨️

We’ll be bringing back our oldies weekend for the 2nd time this year, so get yourselves into this chat so you’re part of the organisation so you can 100% make it - what else you gonna be doing with your weekends, having a life? I think not. You’ll be here, hanging with your besties and doing what you do best - being up to no good 👟🍾. SO, join this chat, it’s probably gonna be the only fun you have all year round https://m.me/ch/AbaLo3M6BjMmg3N0/?send_source=cm:copy_invite_link

We’ve managed to secure a massive discount for this session with tickets only being £20 for a recreational pass and £22 (lesson pass) for included transport to and from Leeds, a lesson (lesson pass) and all snow gear rental (skies, helmet, poles, boots). Take advantage of our subsidies and get yourself back on the slopes!!

Please bring some warm clothes as snow-zone are not supplying jackets as-well as gloves if you have any (there will be gloves you can buy there if needed). 

On top of all this madness there will be a BLUE COLOURED theme and some challenges on the day so be prepared as details will come soon.

Tickets are expecting so sell out extremely fast so here is the link  

https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/events/products/8388

Can’t wait to see you all on Monday next week. But that’s it for now from us.

Piste and Love xx

[25/09/2024, 2:29:19 pm] Paddy SheffSnow Don't Forget!: Hey people, 
Already looking forward to a sheff snow social? Of course you bloody are. Making our Roar debut this year, we are going for a mad one. PUB GOLF, dress in your finest attire, I wanna see some naughty muddied up chinos by the end of the night. 

You better not be late, you better bring a pen and you better chop everything in sight, or you will feel my wrath. You will be assigned a team and scorecard per entry. Me and Morgan will be referees so we better not see any foul play, or serious consequences will follow. 

Make sure you grab ROAR ticket by: Purchasing and collecting from us at the Sports Fair on Friday 27th Sept, at our welcome bbq on Saturday 28th Sept, from Paddy at 16:00 - 18:00 at bar one on Monday the 30th sept or from Morgan at Bar one between 15:00 - 17:00 on Tuesday the 1st oct. Tickets can only be purchased in person and won't be handed out on the Night!!

The route and timings will be: 
	•	18:00 - The edge (so you silly freshers don’t get lost, utter woke nonsense)
	•	19:30 - Cavendish  
	•	21:00 - West Street live 
	•	22:00  -Bierkeller 
	•	23:00 - Bar 1
	•	00:00 - Roar
Freshers make sure you’re at the Edge for 18:00 (DON’T BE LATE) and the rest of you upstanding citizens at Cavendish for 19:30 to be assigned your team, and first challenge!! 

Get keen,
SheffSnow x

[26/09/2024, 1:09:17 pm] Ruby Allen: Attention SheffSnowers old and new!!

We are back on campus and raring to go. Whether you’ve never heard of us, or you’re a seasoned aprés goer, come along to see us THIS FRIDAY (27th September) at the Student’s Union Sports Fair. We will be at stall 22 in the Octagon and on the concourse from 11am-4pm, so come down, say hello, and ask us anything.

Never tried skiing or snowboarding before but always wanted to check it off your bucket list? Come down and ask about our GIAG event on the 30th September! We have so many ways for you all to get involved. From bi-weekly socials, to racing, and two huge trips abroad, SheffSnow has something for everyone. The DISCOUNTED merch bundles will also be available to buy from the stall (See previous Insta post). This merch is only available to buy IN PERSON, so get yourselves down to try some on, and become a SheffSnow stash warrior.

Memberships will be available to buy at the stall! This year memberships are £39 and include lots of goodies, so make sure you come along to claim your freshers pack! We will also be selling and handing out tickets for our FIRST Roar social (2nd Oct). Tickets for this social must be bought and collected in person, so make sure you get down bright and early before they sell out!

Can’t wait to spread some piste and love among you all again,

https://forms.gle/MQydwgHurBNJb2Jx9

Kings is the biggest UK ski and snowboard race league where uni teams race against each other in parallel slalom in dry ski slopes across the UK. It doesn’t even matter if you have never raced before, as long as you can link turns and use a lift you can join a team. If racing doesn’t take your fancy but you still want to come, there will be some fun challenges and activities keep you busy and enjoying yourself.

Tickets are set at £15 for spectators and £20 for racers, and tickets should be released in the couple of days so keep an eye out. 👀👀

If you have any questions please pop us a message on the kings chat

[01/10/2024, 12:38:39 pm] Paddy SheffSnow Don't Forget!: Yooo family,
You lot better be keen for our first official social tomorrow. It’s a big one so please listen carefully or punishments will be coming your way. Now here is the deal:
I want everyone dressed in the most posh, private school attire, I’m talking chinos, cashmere sweaters or other golf related attire… not up to scratch? I’ll be the decider on that. You also NEED A PEN/PENCIL, and freshers I want you all at the edge for 18:00 (DON’T BE LATE) other respectable members who aren’t first year, feel free to come to the cavendish for 19:30, then bierkeller at 22:00, and bar one at 23:00.
There will be rules for each pub so make sure u listen up before running to the bar!!

There will be four teams which u will be marked with on entry, and a member of committee will be your captain. Also remember me and morgz will be refs so no foul play or I’ll Michael Oliver you lot. 

Anyways get excited and hammered, and most importantly enjoy the social. 

Sincerely your favourite social sec,
Pads. 
Piste and love.

[02/10/2024, 11:58:40 am] Euan Gilroy: Hello you lovely lot. Kings tickets are live and selling, so get yours well you still can.

Kings is a fun, very unserious competition where northern unis battle it out on the slopes to be the best. Racers need to be able to link turns and use a lift. While spectators need to be ready for fun challenges and hydration competitions to show why sheff snow are the best. 

The theme for this lovely round of kings is lobsters and mobsters. So we want racers dressing up as those fast lobsters and spectators as mobsters.

Remember to bring food and drink for the whole day as well as warm clothes for the day. It can be as cold as the alps out there so wrap up warm. 

Racers will need to bring gloves and long top and bottoms, all the rest of the kit can be provided by us or rented at the ski slope. 
Remember to bring some cheeky refreshments for the coach ride back 🤪🤪

Link to the event is below, so grab those tickets while you can

[03/10/2024, 7:44:09 pm] Sleepy Sec SheffSnow: Dearest of SheffSnowers, 

The launch for our winter trip  is upon us, so here is your comprehensive guide to the night in question: 

1. Arrive at Mojo at 7pm sharp in your best YELLOW MINION outfits; prizes and forfeits will be awarded so get out the yellow face paint 
2. Chow down on some of the finest pizza Sheffield has to offer ( for ✨freeeeeeee✨) whilst your committee tell you all the key information about the best week of your life (the Winter Trip … duh)
3. 8pm - the moment arrives, the trip launches, you book on, you celebrate 🎊
4. At 9:30pm Morgan and Paddy take the reigns and take you on a bar crawl to rival a Folie Douce aprés by heading to the fancy new establishment of Four Leaf Irish Bar and then the beloved Tiger Works 🐅
5. If you’re feeling brave head down to Tank or Corp (TBD on the night by you lot!) where tickets can bought on the door
As we have already sold nearly 40% of places on the trip in the early bird launch, our waitlist will automatically open and all you need to do is put down the £150 deposit to secure your place so if someone changes their mind you will automatically take their place😈
Our friends over at SHUSnow have got some sweet deals at Mojo:
- FREE pizza🍕
- FREE shots 🥃
- FREE beer pong (beer included)🍻
- 2 for £10 cocktails🍹
- 20% off ALL drinks 
If that doesn’t sound like a recipe for a good night, I don’t know what does so get yourselves down to the launch and make the best decision of your life!
We will be also be giving prizes out at certain numbers of bookers… think tequila 🍋‍🟩

Any questions message the “SheffSnow Winter Trip” sub community and I will endeavour to reply to your message ASAP 🫶🏼

Piste and love, 

A very excited SheffSnow xoxo

We will be carrying out challenges and activities for you all to do with your friends and engage with other unis (I know grim) with the chance of winning prizes. They will be a food stand as well at the ski slope so you can get some warm food and refreshments to keep you going throughout the day. It’s a really nice day out for everyone, weather permitting, and something not to be missed

[14/10/2024, 11:57:09 am] Emma Caamano Sheffsnow: Hey SheffSnowers! 

We are running a cancer awareness & consent talk with Oddballs and FemSoc. Think a few chill pints and some food whilst being educated. As a club the topics that will be covered in the talks are very important to us. If you are wanting to become a member these topics should be important to you too, so it would mean a lot if you all came along. 

See you on the 22nd October 6:30pm Raynor lounge (bar one) 

Wanting to attend our winter ball or UXD? Priority for tickets to these events will be allocated to those who attend this talk! Need more convincing to come? Everyone who attends will be entered into a raffle with a chance to win some amazing prizes such as: alcohol, merch, a roar ticket, a stoke training ticket, free workshop on the trip, oddballs pants & Tuesday Club guestlist 👀 

Piste and love, 

SheffSnow x

PS. There will be a card machine available on the day for you to purchase more raffle tickets. All money raised from this will be donated to OddBalls.

My mission is to create a welcoming, inclusive space for all postgrads, whether new to Sheffield or already part of uni life here. I want to bring postgrads together through fun events, newsletters and chances to connect, and of course get as many people to join us throughout the year for SheffSnow antics ;).

I’d really appreciate your support - voting is now OPEN and closes THIS Thursday at noon!

We are heading down to Stoke dry slope on Monday 21st of October. We will be leaving Goodwin at 4 and returning about midnight. Tickets have just dropped and we are expecting another sellout so get on them asap. The frequency of training sessions are going to slow down as it has been a hectic first few weeks, so make sure to get your tickets to this one. 

This session we are not providing lessons therefore to join us u will have to be able to link turns and safely stop.

Aside from all that make sure you have some warm clothes as well as gloves and grab urself a bargain. 
 
Can’t wait to see you all it’s going to be an active one. ❄️❄️❄️

To help everyone reach their 60k target for the month we are going to try run every park run in November. If you don't know what park run is, it's a super chill 5k around Endcliffe Park, you just go at your own pace and take in the scenery. 

It will be different committee members there every week but look out for SheffSnow stash and you'll find one of us. We will try send a pic every week of who's there and where we are stood. Meet by the start line at 8.50 ish every week.

Hope to see you all there 💪

[29/10/2024, 11:00:57 am] Ruby Allen: 🥊 Hi Everyone!! 🥊

On Saturday 14th December I'll be competing in Round 4 of Fight Night 🥊. Over the next 7 weeks I'm hoping to transform from a mediocre skier to a boxing beast 🧌

I'd love love for you all to be there, and I'm able to reserve tables before they go live (and you get out of the 10% booking fee lucky you 🤑). So if you'd be interested in coming along to see me be well and truly humbled in under 10 minutes then drop me a message. It's also an excuse to get all dressed up and boozed up, so even a good night out nevertheless. Added bonus mum and dad Allen will be there shouting from the sidelines so it's well worth the money just to see them.

All of this is in aid of Oddballs, an amazing charity that is raising awareness of testicular cancer 🍒. I'm hoping to raise £500 for the event, so please help me get there if you can. The link to donate is below:

https://givestar.io/gs/wilder-fight-night-sheffield-round-4-77046

[30/10/2024, 9:44:10 am] Emma Caamano Sheffsnow: 🥸 SheffSnow takes on Movember 🥸

Throughout November, SheffSnow are aiming to raise as much money as possible for Movember, an incredible charity aiming to raise awareness of men’s mental health.

So how can you get involved?

For the guys, it’s pretty simple, shave your tache on the 1st, and keep it growing till the 30th. We’ve set up a dedicated Movember WhatsApp chat where we will be asking for weekly update pictures. 

For the girlies, the aim is to run/walk/swim/cycle 60k over the month, to remember the 60 men who lose their lives to suicide every hour. Record all your activities on Strava, and take lots of pics, we can’t wait to see how you’re staying active. We would love for everyone to get involved with the 60k challenge, not just the girls.

We are planning to run dedicated sessions throughout the month to help everyone reach their target. We will be at every park run throughout the month, but we would really love for EVERYONE to be at the park run on the 9th November, decked out in SheffSnow merch.

As part of oldies weekend, on Sunday 17th November, we will be doing a long sponsored walk, route tbc. Make sure to join the whatsapp chat as we will be planning other walks with the people involved. 

Finally, on 29th November, after the Easter trip launch, we will be running a Bongo’s Bingo style event, with all proceeds from bingo tickets going to Movember.

Please don’t forget to set up your DONATION PAGE on the movember website. Instructions on how to do this are in the ‘Charities’ highlight on our Instagram.

Piste and Taches,

SheffSnow x

[02/11/2024, 6:41:34 pm] Ruby Allen: Back to back Roars? Of course! Are you excited? You better be. sorry its a little late but the ROAR request form is now up for the 6th. This time we are getting family orientated, shipped off you your new parents for the night. Yes, freshers you are babies, so dress accordingly! Now Second years, going into your middle age, so show your quarter life crisis and dress as milfs/dilfs. Now third years, with all your wisdom dress as grandparents. And 4th+ years, seeing as you’re applying for mortgages in a year you’re basically there, dress as a skeleton.

Now seeing as you have been adopted into a new loving family, you must ever show your love and not leave your family until bar one. You will all have to be within 2 metres of your family, if there are any strays then paddy and Morgan will be ready to whip out the measuring tape and assign your punishment (two fingers length of your drink for every metre). So dress nice and get keen.

*Ticket will be £7 this week as £1 from each request will be donated to Movember*

Bar crawl:

Bloomery 20:00 (DON’T BE LATE)
The Harley 21:00
Bierkeller 22:00
Bar one 23:00
Roar 00:00 

Anyone who won a roar ticket make sure you select that option within the payment section.

[02/11/2024, 7:00:36 pm] Ruby Allen: 👙✨ *SheffSnow Winter Merch Drop* ✨👙

Some very EXCITING news coming to you on this fine Saturday evening. On *FRIDAY 8TH NOVEMBER AT 9AM*, our very steezy new merch will be going on sale. This merch will be here just in time for our January trip to Tignes, so if you are heading to France with us don't miss your chance to get kitted out before you get some extreme FOMO. 

The following items will be available:
Snoods - £15
Boonies - £20
Beanies - £18
Headbands - £18
Bikini Tops - £10
Swimming Trunks - £10

This is a *very* limited drop so don't hesitate to order on Friday. If we have extreme demand, we will look to order more, but that will not be before the Winter Trip. The deadline to buy bikinis and trunks is *25th November* as we are ordering these in exact sizes. 

The Quarterzips order will be done a little later as these take much longer to manufacture, so keep an eye out for updates. If you need a reminder of what the merch will look like, head over to issue 2 of the newsletter for the mockups.

Any questions drop Freddy or me a message.

Piste and Love,

SheffSnow xx 🕺🏂⛷️

If you have checked your *inboxes this morning* you will have seen an email about the key dates for the release of our Easter trip!  

After the launch on *Friday 29th of November* we will be hosting a Bingo in aid of Movember! The theme for this is *famous people with moustaches* think Mario, 118 Men, Hulk Hogan, Freddie Mercury. 

We will be giving away loads of fab *prizes* including free ski/board hire, workshops on the trip, Four Loko, El Sueño tequila, merch and lots more. Theres even talk of an airfryer 👀 so even if you’re not planning to come on the trip (what are you doing though? 😵‍💫) it is well worth coming along for the social after!

All proceeds will be going to Movember and it is a chance to get a bit silly for charity!

[08/11/2024, 10:51:24 am] Ruby Allen: 👙✨*SheffSnow Winter Merch Drop* ✨👙

MERCH IS LIVE!!!!! This merch will be here just in time for our January trip to Tignes, so if you are heading to France with us don't miss your chance to get kitted out before you get some extreme FOMO. 

The following items are available:
Snoods - £15
Boonies - £20
Beanies - £18
Headbands - £18
Bikini Tops - £10
Swimming Trunks - £10

This is a *very* limited drop so don't hesitate to order on Friday. If we have extreme demand, we will look to order more, but that will not be before the Winter Trip. The deadline to buy bikinis and trunks is *25th November* as we are ordering these in exact sizes. 

The Quarterzips order will be done a little later as these take much longer to manufacture, so keep an eye out for updates. If you need a reminder of what the merch will look like, head over to issue 2 of the newsletter for the mockups.

Any questions drop Freddy or me a message.

Piste and Love,

SheffSnow xx 🕺🏂

Sorry for the overload this afternoon but we also have another chance to participate in a SportsCom Movember event on *Tuesday 26th November, 5-6pm*.

We have a 1 hour slot in the 12 hour walk and we will be walking a set route around Sheffield. Again, this is an amazing chance to reach any 60k targets, and just have a yap with everyone. 

I heard rumours of finishing at *NOTTY HOUSE* for a gorgeous pub tea.

[13/11/2024, 10:20:54 am] Sleepy Sec SheffSnow: Hello SheffSnow,

This Easter we are heading to *Pas De La Casa* in Andorra from the *5th to the 12th of April*! With 210 km of pistes in the Grandvalaria area there is plenty to do from cruisey blues to deep pow on the off piste and a sick snowpark to practise your steeeeezy tricks! 

With high altitude skiing and a great snow record, Pas De La Casa is perfect for all, whether you’re learning to ski or are seasoned boarder there is something for you in Pas.  

This holiday includes a *FREE upgraded lift pass* for the whole Grandvalaria and because we are heading to Andorra, *TAX FREE* refreshments 😉 this week is bound to be a blast!

Here are some key bits of information:
- *Transfer times* are now in our linktree or use this link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/105O0tYZsZOd1YoF_geB8ydKLyU1YkXv7b4qu3k8OTco/edit
- If you book flights *before 5pm tomorrow* you will be given an early access code to book onto the trip once you have filled in this form https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeV0zhRK6vCzI97ms_h4F2DPLG32iytj91XLeL5uQT1Sg_npw/viewform?usp=sf_link
- Early bird goes *live on Friday at 10 am* so be on it as spaces are very limited 
- Don’t forget to set up a NUCO account, the link to this can be found in our linktree (*EVERYONE* needs to do this as they have changed their system)
- All that needs to be paid now to secure your place is the £150 deposit 
- Here is the booking pack we have made with all the information you could possibly need! https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qa4BTA7BQN-x7R_v8cqlCiZEXEAtkdRvZj76ASyO6IA/edit

We hope you are as excited as we are 🫶🏼

Piste and love,

- join the Easter Trip sub community to stay up to date on everything going on

With the impending launch of our Easter Trip, here is your guide for *FRIDAY 29TH NOVEMBER*! This is a long message with super important info, ignore at your own peril.

The whole evening will be at *Mojo* so expect FREE PIZZA, beer pong and lots of flaming cocktails

*7pm* - Meet at Mojo for a super quick presentation with some important information about the Easter trip for the week and maybe a refreshment or two

*7.45 pm* - EASTER TRIP GENERAL SALE GOES LIVE. Set your alarms, make your NUCO accounts, and get your £150 deposit ready. After Early Bird sales, our trip is already over 50% sold out, so it’s well worth coming along to Mojo for the best chances of booking onto the trip

*Insider Information* - It generally takes us a few minutes to get the codes out on social media so attending in person gives you the best chances

*8 pm* - Arrive for Bingo night in aid of Movember 🥸. Bingo will start at 8.30pm prompt, so if you aren’t coming to the Easter trip launch, make sure you get to Mojo for 8pm so you have time to get a drink and get your bingo dabbers ready.

This *Tuesday 26/11 from 5-6pm* SheffSnow are taking part in a 12 hour walk for Movember. 

The route for the walk is: https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1Rz1vtfbaF0QpYPr-iyPKEz_kw7W61H8&usp=sharing 
The route starts and finishes on the SU concourse. This is so we can handover to the next club taking part in the walk. 

It would be amazing to see some of you there, and hopefully pop in for a pie at Notty house after 🥳 ‎<This message was edited>

[03/12/2024, 1:53:42 pm] Ruby Allen: 🚌 BUS BACK FROM VARSITY 🚌

Hey everyone,

Like we did last year, we are thinking about putting on a coach back from the ice hockey for everyone in SheffSnow. There would be 52 spaces available so it would be first come first served. Due to the increased costs of coaches, it would be about £3 each to get on the coach. Its much easier than trying to get on a tram back, and having to queue in the rain.

Please don't forget to join the *varsity whatsapp chat* if this is something that you'd be interested in!

With the *biggest* social of the semester coming up, we thought we would offer you lucky lot for the chance to *guarantee yourself a Roar ticket*! 
For you silly fresh you might be wondering why this Roar is such a big deal, here’s why; tickets sell out on the SU website within seconds so the only way to guarantee yourself one is through us! 
Although we only have enough tickets for 10% of our club (big sad🥲)! Want to secure one? Here’s how:
•	Simply get 2 friends to book on to the Easter trip – this might seem like a lot but all that needs to be paid until late January is £150 (SFE can’t come soon enough!)
•	Then send us proof before Tuesday 12pm (midday) and we will ensure you get a Roar ticket!
Piste and UXD love,

Hey SheffSnow,

With 5 hours until our events go live, what better time to book onto the trip? Our Winter Trip events sold out in 2 minutes so be sure to book on at 4pm tomorrow or else you’ll have the worst FOMO! 😔

Here’s a reminder of what we have planned for our week out in Andorra:
- NUCO sounds opening aprés: the biggest up and coming DJs sound tracking the first aprés of the trip 🍾
- SheffSnow pre-drinks party: 90 minutes of unlimited beer and a buffet, what more could you ask for? 🍻
- Rail jam, BBQ & aprés: you didn’t think we’d let the racers have all the fun? Show off your best tricks with some sweet sweet prizes to be won! With a yummy BBQ alongside what better way to spend an afternoon🕺
- NUCO sounds club night: dance the night away with NUCO’s best DJs providing the tunes 🪩

Hire will also be available to select when events go live so remember to book that if you need it! 

Any questions pop a message in the subchat!

Piste and love,
SheffSnow xox ‎<This message was edited>

[16/12/2024, 2:08:43 pm] Ruby Allen: Ho ho ho,

Since you were all so good to Santa at the Christmas meal, she's got you all an extra special present: the UXD plan! Please read carefully. It is recommended to be there from 9am if you love this club (and free food). If you can only join later in the day however we would love for you to join the chaos whenever you can. 

Right troops, get in line:

*9am* - Meet at *CAVENDISH* for a delicious (and FREE) breakfast. Expect mini games, wine, and a thorough run down of the day ahead

*11am-2pm* - Spoons bar crawl. From this point on you will be split into two teams for a race across Sheffield. Anyone who you called a friend is now your mortal enemy. The bar crawl will take the format of *VALLEY RALLEY*, so complete as many challenges for points as you can. Most points wins the pleasure of deciding a forfeit for the other team. 

*1pm* - At your second or third spoons, this will be the dedicated *LUNCH STOP*. Grab some carby scran to get you through the day. I heard that the silliest fresher gets to choose the social secs meal

*2-2.30pm* - Pit stop at *concourse*. If you came last year you know the drill. If you didn't, get to know

*2.30-4pm* - CVP Challenges. *Beveraginos will be required*. Tinnies preferred. Wine if you're nasty. If you don't it's coffee tequila.

*4pm-5pm* - Dam House debrief. Time for a sit down, final pint before the break. Digest what's just occurred. Last year Morgan turned up in his canoe skirt, fingers crossed for that again

*5pm-8pm* - Go home and have some alone time with your thoughts. Eat lots and *DON’T NAP*. Trust me it's not worth the risk

*8pm-10pm* - Endcliffe flat crawl. Freshers check your inbox we will be messaging you to plan. Please bring your own drinks. Aura provided

*10.30pm* - Bar One. Classic push and shove gig to get a passion bomb

Should be writing her dissertation - me
Doing personal admin instead - me

Piste and Love,

[17/12/2024, 9:35:09 pm] Sleepy Sec SheffSnow: 💸*MONEY SAVING TIPS* 💸

Hey sheffsnow,

With not long until Santa is coming down our chimneys we thought we’d give you an early Christmas present on how to save some money when it comes to the trip:

- *Participation grant 2 in second semester*: apply for the second round of the participation grant which can be used for training (SnoZone & Stoke), equipment & Kings/ competitions 🎿
- *Bring food from home!* Pasta & sauce are great for dinners and easy to fit in your luggage plus much cheaper than buying them in resort! Snacks are also much cheaper to buy before you go🍝
- Andorra is *tax free!* All alcohol will be much cheaper than in the UK and Duty Free! 🍻
- *Only the £150 deposit needs to be paid until 23/01/2025!!* Which is after the second SFE drop 🏦
- *Lots of kit can be found second hand!* Check Vinted, charity shops, Facebook Marketplace and I’m sure you will find some bargains 👔
- If you are considering *booking flights*, book now before they get too expensive! We still are looking into another coach but can’t guarantee anything unfortunately 🛩️

There are now *less than 15% of spaces* left for the trip, however there are a few event tickets left so don’t worry about missing out!!! 🪩


Any questions let just drop us a message! 

Sweet dreams before UXD,
SheffSnow 🎅

I hope you all had an amazing 2024, I'm very very excited to see what 2025 holds for the club ❄️

The 2025 gods are shining down on you all because the merch is here! And even better news, the *SHERPA QUARTER ZIPS* have made a miraculous appearance with it. Booby have arisen from their tomb and are once again braving the journey to Potters Bar to intercept the coach and deliver the merch for the trip. Tignes here we come!!

The quarter zips are *£42* and will drop at *12:00 on Friday 3rd January*, so set your alarms and get ready to beat the ticket war as stock is EXTREMELY LIMITED. The jumpers are fluffy, have pockets, a soft lining, and an adjustable elastic waistband so you can get the perfect baggy fit 🪩. 

Here is a reminder of all of the other merch available to buy:
	- Headbands - £18
	- Beanies - £18
	- Boonies - £20
	- Snoods - £15

Link to buy: https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/events/products/9857

Frebby is sending some pictures in now of all the merch if you needed any more convincing! We will be running collections throughout the week in Tignes if you fancy coming to try on the merch or have a look before you buy. We will also be running a collection when we return in January so keep your eyes peeled for details.

Happy Shopping,

[03/01/2025, 11:39:23 am] Ruby Allen: ✈️ FLYING TO PAS DE LA CASA ✈️

Due to very limited coach space, the majority of people are flying to Barcelona and then getting an airport transfer for our Easter Trip. I've had a few messages from people a little hesitant to book on because of flying solo. Let me reassure you that you will probably be looking at the exact same flights as someone else! 

Most of our committee are flying to the trip, and have shared our flight details on the Easter trip chat. Head over to the Easter trip sub chat, pop in a message of where you were thinking of flying from, and see if you can find a flight buddy.

I personally have flown to 2 trips solo now, and it's been great. Nice bit of peace before a week of chaos.  I've always come across people from SheffSnow in the airports.

If you have any concerns, please pop me a message and we can work something out. Don't want you to miss out on the best week of the year!

Don't forget to look at flights that align with the NUCO transfer times (linked in our LinkTree)

Piste and Love,

SheffSnow ✈️✈️

[03/01/2025, 12:00:40 pm] Ruby Allen: Happy Friday everyone,

Quarter Zips are officially live to buy! Beth has worked super hard to subsidise these down to £42 for you all, so enjoy!! Student finance drops in a few weeks, treat yourself.

Link to buy: https://su.sheffield.ac.uk/events/id/9660-sheffsnow-sherpa-quarter-zips

Please make sure you buy the right size, there is a product for every size (S-XL). We have very limited stock of S and XL sizes, so please don't wait to buy these if you were wanting these sizes in particular!

Reminder that a collection will be scheduled in Tignes, and at the end of January in Sheffield.

Can't wait to see these around campus,

This is your official *10 day warning* to book onto our Easter Trip to Pas De La Casa!! Full payment is due on the 23rd Jan, so start the process now by paying your deposit then you don't have to pay it all in one go!! ✨✨

A reminder that the coach has *sold out* so please have a look at flights, most are the same price as the coach. As always, it is worth a message to NUCO on the live chat to see if anyone has cancelled their space on the coach. ✈️

Piste and Love,

[10/02/2025, 9:09:37 am] Ruby Allen: Happy Varsity Season to all those that celebrate 💛🖤,

A month of poly-bashing is on the cards, and of course as respectable citizens SheffSnow have to do our bit to add to that all important varsity score. 

On *Thursday 27th March*, we will pile 2 by 2 onto our black and gold coach down to our second home in Stoke. *Snowsports varsity is for EVERYONE*, whether you want to race, throw a few tricks, or simply spectate like your life depends on it, we would love to have you there.

The day of being superior in every way will go as follows:
*Pickup from BAR ONE* - 11:45
*Team slalom races* - 14:00-15:30
*Freestyle* - 15:30-17:30
*Awards Ceremony* - 21:00-Lights on

If this looks like something you could get on board with, and would like a space on the bus, please FILL IN THE SIGN UP SHEET (also linked in the Linktree): 

https://forms.gle/ebgxh2PJmLUQvq7fA

If we have too many sign-ups to race, our lovely competitions sec will be choosing teams based on attendance and performance at Kings + Stoke sessions, so please indicate if you’d want to spectate too if we are overwhelmed with racing responses.

The theme for the day and evening social is of course black and gold. We will be coming armed with black and gold face paint, please ask Charles for reference pictures of how your war paint should look.

Seems like a bad day to be H*ll*m,

SheffSnow xox 💛🖤

Please note: Varsity is a *NON-DRINKING* event, alcohol is only permitted at the social after ‎<This message was edited>
[10/02/2025, 9:59:53 am] Ruby Allen: 🪩 *REFRESHERS FAIR TOMORROW* 🪩

So come and see us for posters, stickers, lip balms, coasters, and some excellent chat 🤭.

Hey guys!! 
Quite a few of our members are running the half marathon. If you’re not a keen runner (like me) but still want to get involved this is the perfect opportunity. The plan is to get involved with volunteering as a route marshal. This just involves standing to guide the runners on their route and cheering them on! If this is something you would be interested in please like this message! It would be great to have as many of you involved as possible for this great cause 🫶

23rd March 8am - 1pm

Transport services are making it extremely hard to organise any transport for the Stoke session on Monday so we are going to have to cancel the session. Sorry there have not been any race training sessions this semester but there is nothing we can do about it. Allthough this session has been cancelled transport should be all sorted for any Stoke sessions in the future.

Piste and love 
Sheffsnow ❄️❄️❄️
[13/03/2025, 11:46:20 am] Will Edwards Sheffsnow: Allthough it’s sold out there are a couple tickets being resold for snozone tonight. It’s our last session of the year and could be a good to get practice in before Easter trip. There is 1 ski lesson and one recreational pass being sold at the moment. Message me if u want one. ‎<This message was edited>

[13/03/2025, 3:00:34 pm] Sleepy Sec SheffSnow: 🏩 * ROOM ALLOCATIONS ARE LIVE* 🏩

hey guys, 

Pas De La Casa rooms are now live! 

here’s how to select your room & room mates:

1. Log into your NUCO account and go to your bookings
2. Go to allocations
3. You'll see every room available to your trip, and can allocate yourself and your mates into a room provided you know everyones booking reference number
4. It may take some moments to load / catch up as increased capacity goes through the booking page, so just be patient! 

make sure to have everyone’s booking references!

allocations will *shut 24 hours later* at 15:00 on Friday (14/03) so make sure to be quick! 

*anyone who does not allocate themselves into a room will be randomly allocated into one!*

any questions just send me a message!

All further info regarding word count and presentation time limit is in the form so please give it a read. For info on available roles please head over to our Instagram.

2️⃣ *SHEFFSNOW BEST & WORST MOMENTS* - as part of the AGM I will be presenting a review of the year, and for this I need your best best, worst best, best worst, and worst worst moments. When you have five minutes please could you write down all your funniest and embarrassing moments for me to dissect at AGM.

I've been making canva my slave for this, I just need more of your best bits and piccies 🔔🔔

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1369GkpKuSEXHb6o6o0ZQLCNi59aJcZD4xluczRnlvLI/edit?usp=drivesdk

You don't have to fill in every question, can just give me your best best or worst worst moments if you're passionate.

I should be doing my diss but this is more important,

[16/04/2025, 8:55:35 pm] Sleepy Sec SheffSnow: Hey, you should have received an email today (or if not in the next couple of days) about your damage deposit from our easter trip 🤑

*any issues or disputes with your deposit contact NUCO customer service via their online chat function* 

If you’ve not been on a trip you also may need to enter your bank details online via your account - details are in the email x ‎<This message was edited>
[17/04/2025, 9:45:38 am] Ruby Allen: It’s coming to the end of another era. It feels almost mandatory that we’ve got to sesh it out in one last big Celebration. Of course I'm talking about the SheffSnow 2025 Snow Ball! ❄️ 

We’ve once again booked out Grappa for Wednesday the 7th of May at 19:00. Prices are estimated to cost £30 per person however a finalised cost along with food options & seating preferences will be sent out within the sign up form released this friday (18th) in the group chats. This price will include (PP):
- main course
- half a bottle of wine
- choice between a starter or a desert.

The menu will also have vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options. Discounted drinks will also be available for purchase at Grappa throughout the night. 🍺

This somewhat “sophisticated” event gives us all that one last chance to get absolutely twatted before the dreaded exam season. So dress up all fancy in your finest suits, dresses and ties. Everyone is free to bring plus ones, however make sure they have also bought a ticket.

You can also expect the return of the much anticipated awards ceremony to laugh at and remind ourselves who's done the most stupid things this year that they'd hoped everyone would forget. Submissions for different awards will be included within the signup form. 🏆 

Pres and group photos will be held as tradition at the waterworks wetherspoons/city hall from 18:00. Legend has it, there might even be free booze for those who show up on time.

To top it all off in true SheffSnow fashion we will absolutely be ROARing afterwards till lights on. Options to get yourself a ticket will also be included within the form released on the 18th. 🐯 

Piste and Ball Love, 
SheffSnow xxx
