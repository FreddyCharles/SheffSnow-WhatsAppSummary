[25/03/2025, 9:47:24 am] Ruby Allen: 🔥 *MERCH AND MEMBERS TEE SALE/COLLECTION TONIGHT* 🔥

Hey everyone,

Tonight at *Berlin calling* I'll be bringing along what we have left of last years merch (T shirts, canterburys, hoodies) to sell off super cheap. 

I'll also be bringing members tees if you've yet to collect yours. If you're like me and have worn yours to death we will be selling spares for £3 each so get down and grab yourself a bargain 👀

Remember that from *6pm tonight* we will be making varsity signs for Thursday and watching some exclusive Faction films 🎥 

Piste and Love,

SheffSnow ✨️

[13/04/2025, 4:12:25 pm] Ruby Allen: 👀 *AGM & END OF YEAR REVIEW* 👀

Hey there SheffSnow,

To anyone who was in Pas, a huge huge thank you from myself and the rest of committee, we had the best week and we hope you did too 🫶 Just two quick things to have a think about over Easter:

1️⃣ *AGM NOMINATIONS* - Please don't forget to write your manifesto and prepare your presentation for our AGM on *Monday 5th May*. All further info regarding word count and presentation time limit is in the form so please give it a read. For info on available roles please head over to our Instagram.

🤵🏻‍♂️ *Nomination Form:* https://forms.gle/rCoMcSZfpzLwrFPU9

2️⃣ *SHEFFSNOW BEST & WORST MOMENTS* - as part of the AGM I will be presenting a review of the year, and for this I need your best best, worst best, best worst, and worst worst moments. When you have five minutes please could you write down all your funniest and embarrassing moments for me to dissect at AGM.

🪩 *End of Year Review Form:* https://forms.gle/ys6qBv2VUvHHPbK68

Piste and Love,

SheffSnow x

[16/04/2025, 8:36:32 pm] Ruby Allen: 😈 *SHEFFSNOW REVIEW* 😈

Reminder to fill in your highs and lows of the year for my end of year review ✨️

I've been making canva my slave for this, I just need more of your best bits and piccies 🔔🔔

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1369GkpKuSEXHb6o6o0ZQLCNi59aJcZD4xluczRnlvLI/edit?usp=drivesdk

You don't have to fill in every question, can just give me your best best or worst worst moments if you're passionate.

I should be doing my diss but this is more important,

SheffSnow x

[16/04/2025, 8:55:35 pm] Sleepy Sec SheffSnow: Hey, you should have received an email today (or if not in the next couple of days) about your damage deposit from our easter trip 🤑

*any issues or disputes with your deposit contact NUCO customer service via their online chat function* 

If you’ve not been on a trip you also may need to enter your bank details online via your account - details are in the email x ‎<This message was edited>

[17/04/2025, 9:45:38 am] Ruby Allen: It’s coming to the end of another era. It feels almost mandatory that we’ve got to sesh it out in one last big Celebration. Of course I'm talking about the SheffSnow 2025 Snow Ball! ❄️ 

We’ve once again booked out Grappa for Wednesday the 7th of May at 19:00. Prices are estimated to cost £30 per person however a finalised cost along with food options & seating preferences will be sent out within the sign up form released this friday (18th) in the group chats. This price will include (PP):
- main course
- half a bottle of wine
- choice between a starter or a desert.

The menu will also have vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options. Discounted drinks will also be available for purchase at Grappa throughout the night. 🍺

This somewhat “sophisticated” event gives us all that one last chance to get absolutely twatted before the dreaded exam season. So dress up all fancy in your finest suits, dresses and ties. Everyone is free to bring plus ones, however make sure they have also bought a ticket.

You can also expect the return of the much anticipated awards ceremony to laugh at and remind ourselves who's done the most stupid things this year that they'd hoped everyone would forget. Submissions for different awards will be included within the signup form. 🏆 

Pres and group photos will be held as tradition at the waterworks wetherspoons/city hall from 18:00. Legend has it, there might even be free booze for those who show up on time.

To top it all off in true SheffSnow fashion we will absolutely be ROARing afterwards till lights on. Options to get yourself a ticket will also be included within the form released on the 18th. 🐯 

Piste and Ball Love, 
SheffSnow xxx
